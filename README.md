.NET project for the 3rd in software engineering web services course at UiA. 
The website allows user to create, manage and log workouts from a database of over 700 different exercises. Users can also share their custom workouts with each other. The website features google signin, email user authentication and utilizes OpenAI's chatGPT API to create custom workouts for user who aren't comfortable with creating their own. The API keys have been removed for obvious reasons. This has the negative affect of removing the AI training, but it should still work without it. API keys are placed in the appsetting.Development.json and Program.cs files.
